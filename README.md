## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2019 to better understand:

1. what technologies other developers currently using? (what tools to use)?
2. What are the working enviroment?
3. what are the currently most used programming language and platform?
4. how many hours on an avergare people dedicate to programming?
5. what are the future of programming?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 2 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook. however i tried my best to reneralize concepts so that even a non technical guy can visualize the work done by me.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available (https://medium.com/@princeamitlali/tech-industry-in-2020-3e20c9db35ba).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available (https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like! https://github.com/princeamitlali/Data_Science_project_1
